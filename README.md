## CodeStar

CodeStar is a demo Android application that takes two github user names and sums up all of the stars
on all of their personal github repositories. The winner is the one with the most stars.

Clicking the users profile photo will take you to their github user page.

The users' repositories are also listed (along with the star count) and is clickable for easy viewing.
